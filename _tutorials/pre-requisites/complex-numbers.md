Complex Number is a mathematical object which is the combination of a Real number and an Imaginary number. A Complex Number, usually, written in the form of \\( a + b \iota \\), where \\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\iota\\) is the `iota`. Here \\(a\\) is the `real part` of the complex number and \\(b\\) is the `imaginary part` of the complex number.

**Formal Definition:**

> A Complex Number is an ordered pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\\).
The set of all complex numbers is represented by \\(\mathbb{C}\\):
        \\[
                \mathbb{C} = { a + b\iota \mid a, b \in \mathbb{R} }
        \\]

By using the above definition, we can write any `real number` **a** as \\((a, 0)\\) whereas any `imaginary number` **b**\\(\iota\\) can be written as \\((0, b)\\).

**Additon of two Complex Numbers:**

We can add two complex numbers just by adding their respective real parts and complex parts, as described below:
> Let \\((a + b\iota)\\) and \\((c + d\iota)\\) be two complex numbers, 
        \\[
                (a + b\iota) + (c + d\iota) = (a + c) + (b + d)\iota
        \\]
