# Complex Numbers
Complex Number is a mathematical object which is a combination of a Real numbers and a Imaginary number. A Complex Number, usually, written in the form of $a + bi$, where a, b are Real Numbers and i is the iota (i = sqrt(-1)). Here a will be said as the real part of the Complex Number and b as the Imaginary part of the Complex Number.

Formally defined, a Complex Number is an ordered pair (a, b), where a, b are Real Numbers.
The set of all complex numbers is represented by C:
        C = {a + bi : a, b in R }
