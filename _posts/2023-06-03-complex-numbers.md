# Complex Numbers
Complex Number is a mathematical object which is a combination of a Real numbers and a Imaginary number. A Complex Number, usually, written in the form of \\( a + b \iota \\), where \\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\\) and \\(\iota\\) is the `iota`. Here \\(a\\) is the `real part` of the complex number and \\(b\\) is the `imaginary part` of the complex number.

**Formal Definition:**
> A Complex Number is an ordered pair \\((a, b)\\), \\(a, b \in \mathbb{R}\\).
The set of all complex numbers is represented by \\(\mathbb{C}\\):
        \\[\mathbb{C} = {a + b\iota : a, b \in \mathbb{R} }\\]

By using the above definition, we can write any `real number` **a** as \\((a, 0)\\) whereas any `imaginary number` **b**\\(\iota\\) can be written as \\((0, b)\\).
